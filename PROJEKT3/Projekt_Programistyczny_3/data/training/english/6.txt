In 2012, Bangladesh law minister Shafique Ahmed stated that Mueen-Uddin would be charged for war crimes.[27] However, the prosecution has delayed submitting charges.[28] He is accused of being a top member of the notorious paramilitary force Al-Badr and of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami political party, which fought for the country to remain part of Pakistan.[29] Mueen-Uddin has denied all allegations.[30]
