History

Block Party Bash at Disney's California Adventure July 2007
Block Party Bash was introduced in May 2005 in conjunction with Disneyland's 50th anniversary "Happiest Homecoming on Earth" celebration. Produced to fill the void left after the closure of Eureka!, it was conceived as more a mobile stage show than a parade. Unlike most Disney parades, Block Party Bash is an upbeat show that makes heavy use of dance music with an energetic, driving beat.

Block Party Bash featured characters from and units inspired by the Pixar films released to that point: Toy Story, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, and Monsters, Inc. In addition to the characters, Block Party Bash featured a large number of dancers, bikers, and trampoline artists. The original cast included over 60 dancers, 16 acrobats, 12 pairs of jumping stilts and 30 electric scooters.

Following its initial season, Block Party Bash was significantly scaled down, with its original three show stops being reduced to two, the A Bug's Land stop removed, and the lighting and effects system reworked to require less manpower. The tail end of the Bug's Life unit was also scaled down by removing Dim, with the larger unit losing its trailered unit, and a few party cones.

After closing on January 6, 2008, the parade was relocated to Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Florida. It premiered there on March 14, 2008—the same day that the new Pixar Play Parade debuted at Disney California Adventure.
