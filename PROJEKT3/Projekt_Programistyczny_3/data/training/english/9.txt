The Evangeline League eventually folded following the 1957 season and had never become an integrated league, despite the efforts of major league affiliates to assign players to teams in the league.[29][10][8][3]

Houma was without a minor league team until 2003. The Houma Hawks played as members of the Independent Southeastern League in 2003.[30]
