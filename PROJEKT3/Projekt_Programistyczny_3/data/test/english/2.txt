Failed nomination to federal district court
On February 16, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Cadish to be a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.[2] She would have replaced Judge Philip Martin Pro, who assumed senior status in 2011. Due to the fact that Senator Heller refused to sign and return his blue slip for her nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee would not hold a hearing on her nomination and the Senate could not proceed on the nomination. Heller's opposition to her nomination and his invocation of "senatorial courtesy" is due to a statement by Cadish indicating that she believed there was no individual right to keep and bear arms, a statement which was made in 2008, prior to Supreme Court decisions explicitly recognizing an individual right to keep and bear arms.[3] On January 2, 2013, her nomination was returned to the Senate, due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate.

On January 3, 2013, she was renominated to the same office. On March 8, 2013, she announced that she had requested President Obama to withdraw her nomination.[4] Five days later, Obama formally withdrew her nomination.[5]
